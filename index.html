                As our children are growing, so is their appetite! We have noticed more friends needing supplement food after 
              they finish their lunches from home. Please check in with your teacher and please make sure that 
              all food groups are included; these friends burn lots of energy each day, some day more than others! 
              Here is a chart that may be helpful:
